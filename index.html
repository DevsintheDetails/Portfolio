        <p class="paragraph">
          My interest in software development began in my teens when I just
          happened to be in the offices of the company I worked for and got to
          see how the company created their website. I was amazed at just how
          much one could accomplish with the right knowledge of computers. I was
          a professional skateboarder at the time and the team had little input
          into how the site would ultimately turn out, but the developer asked
          each of us a few questions about our interests and musical tastes.
          When the developer had finished I was blown away with what he had
          done. So a few of the reasons software development drew my interest
          are:

          <li><strong>Constantly learning and evolving my craft.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I still continue to skateboard daily, but skateboarding eventually led
          me into a career as a stuntman, which in turn led me to acting. From
          the first time I set foot on a movie set I loved every aspect of
          creating a film. I have always been a movie fanatic, although it was
          not until I actually got to be a part of the process first hand that I
          found my love for acting. I continue to audition for new roles and I
          get the occasional call to be set on fire, wreck a car, or thrown off
          a building, but these days I have my sights set on learning software
          development.
