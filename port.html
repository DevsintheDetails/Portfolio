      <h2 class="intro">About Me</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My interest in software development began in my teens when I just
        happened to be in the offices of the company I worked for and got to see
        how the company created their website. I was amazed at just how much one
        could accomplish with the right knowledge of computers. I was a
        professional skateboarder at the time and the team had little input into
        how the site would ultimately turn out, but the developer asked each of
        us a few questions about our interest and musical tastes. When the
        developer had finished we were blown away with what he had done. So a
        few of the reasons software development drew my interest are:

        I still continue to skateboard daily, but skateboarding eventually led
        me into a career as a stuntman, which in turn led me to acting. From the
        first time I set foot on a movie set I loved every aspect of creating a
        film. I had always been a movie fanatic, although it was not until I
        actually got to be a part of the process first hand that I found my love
        for acting. I continue to audition for new roles and I get the
        occasional call to be set on fire, wreck a car, or thrown off a
        building, but nowadays I have my sights set on learning software
        development.
